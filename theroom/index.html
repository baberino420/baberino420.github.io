<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">THINGS TO YELL:</span></h1>
<ul>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &rdquo;Spoon!&rdquo;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly all of the artwork in the film features spoons. Whenever one of the works appears on screen, you yell &ldquo;Spoon!&rdquo; and hurl plastic picnic spoons at the screen. Fourth row from the screen essentially makes the whole project self-replenishing, because most spoons land there. You literally throw a handful and another handful falls in your lap. It&rsquo;s like being part of a plastic-cutlery salmon migration. As the film trudges on, people start throwing spoons out of boredom, even if the scene doesn&rsquo;t require it.</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;Sestosterone!&rdquo;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can pretty much yell it any time lost Brawny Quilted Picker-Upper spokesman Greg Sestero is on screen. It is particularly fitting when he&rsquo;s about to be manly about something.</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;Cancer!&rdquo;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa&rsquo;s mother alludes to having it once and then never mentions it again. Also, when she touches Lisa on the nose, some people shout &ldquo;I put my evil inside you!&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &rdquo;Denny!&rdquo;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Used to herald the arrival of the tragic kidult. Also, every time Denny leaves the scene, it is proper to shout &ldquo;Goodbye, Denny!&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &rdquo;One!&rdquo; &ldquo;Two!&rdquo;&hellip; (counting bff allusions)</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sestero&rsquo;s character alludes to being Tommy&rsquo;s best friend between five and seven times in the movie. The number is uncertain because whenever he alludes to it, everyone yells out which number they think it is. Usually, people are hammered enough that by &ldquo;Three!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Four!&rdquo;, two-thirds of the theater has no idea, or thinks they have fallen ahead or behind.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FOCUS! UNFOCUS!!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film is constantly going in and out of focus. (&ldquo;Damn you Todd Barron!&rdquo; He&rsquo;s the director of photography, and that&rsquo;s what you shout when his credit pops up) Whenever the film goes out of focus, people shout &ldquo;Focus!&rdquo; Of course, when it does come back into focus during a sex scene, it is necessary to shout &ldquo;Oh God. Unfocus!&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &rdquo;Shoot her!&rdquo;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yelled during Lisa&rsquo;s protracted neck-twitch scene. (It&rsquo;s a reference to the opening of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurassic Park</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) Also appropriate: &ldquo;Quaid, get to the reactor!&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Various things to yell over B-roll:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Alcatraz!&rdquo;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Alcatraz, or anything framed with bars</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go! Go! Go! Go!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Used to cheer on tracking shots of the bridge. Celebrate when it makes it all the way across the bridge. Express your disappointment when it doesn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Everywhere you look, everywhere you look!&rdquo;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sung over houses that look like the ones from the opening of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, back in San Francisco!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever a shot uses the iconography of the city to verify that, yes, we have not left San Francisco.</span></p>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACTIVITY/CUES</span></h1>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Saying &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; to Tommy when he appears to look down at the corner of the screen during the party scene. This entails running down to the screen and hanging out toward the bottom-right-hand corner and then shouting as his eyes acknowledge you.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As Denny eats the apple which might be the most heavy-handed and irrelevant action in the film, I enjoy shouting &ldquo;Oh, shit! Metaphor!&rdquo; (Seriously, just what the hell is eating the apple supposed to signify? That Denny has given in to temptation? What temptation? What the hell does Denny giving in to temptation have to do with anything?)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When the characters throw the football back and forth, you do the same thing with your friend(s). Since you are drunk and in a darkened movie theater, this usually goes awry. One of my friends accidentally beaned Tommy this way. Another time, someone hit the screen and the theater ownership got pissed.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At one point, two characters will show up in Tommy&rsquo;s apartment. They will be fucking. No one will know who they are, thus it is appropriate to shout &ldquo;Who the fuck are you?&rdquo; whenever they appear onscreen.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is also appropriate to shout this when the actor playing Peter (the psychologist) disappears (maybe he was looking at the camera too much?), only to be replaced by another actor who looks nothing like him. Yes, just &ldquo;Who the fuck are you?&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tommy&rsquo;s deranged giggle, which he delivers at inappropriate moments (&ldquo;He beat her up so bad, she wound up in a hospital on Guerro St.&rdquo; &ldquo;HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!&rdquo;) should be mocked mercilessly.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One of my favorite moments was back in &lsquo;06. Two guys dressed up and acted out the Denny vs. Chris R. scene at the front of the theater while the scene happened onscreen.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &rdquo;The Seventh-Inning Stretch&rdquo; is what we call the longest of the film&rsquo;s gratuitous sex scenes. This is where you piss/smoke. Pros know it&rsquo;s coming and beat the traffic.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Singing along to &ldquo;You Are My Rose&rdquo; and lifting one&rsquo;s phone/lighter. Let&rsquo;s not forget that we are all part of the same wave of undeniable good. A friend noted that they should&rsquo;ve used &ldquo;You Are My Rose&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watchmen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> On that note, breaking into the &ldquo;Yes We Can!&rdquo; chant sometimes works, especially after Tommy&rsquo;s speech about &ldquo;If everybody loved each other, the world would be a better place.&rdquo; This chant started during the election and has continued since. I like to think that&rsquo;s it one of those rare moments where irony and sincerity collide, neither quite dominating the other.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Being open about one&rsquo;s revulsion during any of the sex scenes. Breaking into the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free Willy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> theme is sometimes done. Notice how it looks like Tommy is fucking her belly button? Yeah, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong, Wiseau.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Humming the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mission: Impossible</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> theme when Tommy is hooking the tape deck up to the answering machine. Mind you, this movie was made in 2003 and Tommy (Johnny) was still fucking around with a tape deck, which given the amount of time that passes between this scene and when he plays the recorded conversation, must have been one of those super 72-hour tapes.</span></li>
